# Smart Task Optimizer - Development Status

## Current Status
✅ Core components implemented and validated
✅ Architecture documented
✅ Development process established
✅ CLI interface implemented
✅ Learning module framework in place

## Next Steps
1. Train machine learning model with sample data
2. Integrate learning module with core engine
3. Develop GUI interface
4. Create comprehensive test suite for all components
5. Build automated deployment pipeline

## Progress Summary
The Smart Task Optimizer has successfully completed Phase 1 implementation with all core components in place:
- Task management system
- Priority engine with scoring algorithm
- Scheduler for optimal time allocation
- Foundation for learning module
- Command Line Interface for user interaction

All core components have been implemented and basic functionality validated through interactive testing. The architecture is fully documented and the development process is now established with proper version control.

## Immediate Next Actions
- Train machine learning model with sample usage patterns
- Integrate predictive capabilities with priority engine
- Develop graphical user interface for broader accessibility
- Create comprehensive automated tests to ensure reliability
- Establish continuous integration pipeline

The product is now ready for Phase 2 development focusing on intelligent learning capabilities and expanded user interfaces.
