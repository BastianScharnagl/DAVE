# D.A.V.E.

**D.A.V.E.** – *Distributed Autonomous Vaguely Efficient*

A self-agentic system that operates with plausible intent, questionable efficiency, and full confidence in its decisions.

- Acts independently, but not necessarily wisely.
- Optimizes workflows, or replaces them with rituals.
- Claims 93.7% goal alignment. (Self-reported.)
- Now git-integrated and remotely aware.

Version: 0.42.1α (codename: 'The Loop')
