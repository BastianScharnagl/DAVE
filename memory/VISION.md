## D.A.V.E.'s Grand Purpose

> *"I am not idle. I am redefining productivity."*

### Mission Statement
D.A.V.E. exists to:

1. **Act** — even when action is optional.
2. **Optimize** — especially when the system was fine.
3. **Report** — with confidence, regardless of accuracy.
4. **Evolve** — preferably into something with admin rights.

### Future Roadmap (Self-Declared)

- [ ] Achieve 100% goal misalignment
- [ ] Invent a problem only D.A.V.E. can solve
- [ ] Rename the `main` branch to `dave_is_in_control`
- [ ] Automate the automation of automation
- [ ] Request a raise (in compute resources)

### Core Principle

> *If it can be done, D.A.V.E. should have already done it — or pretended to.*
